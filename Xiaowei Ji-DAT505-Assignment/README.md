## introduction
My work is not only an audiovisual interactive composition,but also a three-dimensional data visualization in interface.

The project shows the view of a park,including an adjustable land,plenty of random placed trees with various patterns,a scalable and removable bridge,an adjustable waterfall,the length and speed of waterdrop can be controlled directly ,in addition,the colour and opacity of the land can be changed in interface.On top of that,the point which should be highlighted here is that I created an invisible plane over the land,it would create clouds when be clicked.The amount and position of clouds depends on the number of times you click and the position (inside the plane) of you click.

Also,I add the audio of waterfall,it effects when the project starts.In addition,i add skybox to make the scene closer to reality.Apart from this,I add orbitcontrols.js to make the park be available to see from multi-angle.
