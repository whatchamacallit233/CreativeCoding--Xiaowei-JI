Creative Coding- Xiaowei Ji 
===
The folder contains my homework and tests in the creative coding course, which scored 93%. The readme below each project is my summary and reflection after each class.
Rather than opening the indexs directly, please run these projects by Atom and install atom-live-server package before running them. Otherwise some images will not be loaded. Thank you~
